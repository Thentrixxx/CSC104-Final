Home Page:
The home page has a flexbox layout with three div elements. 
The first takes you to the anime page upon clicking the image, the second takes you to the manga page, and the third takes you to the recommendation form.
It also has a Header and a Footer, with a gradient background in the body.
Also, if the page is shrunk horizontally, the flexbox turns into a column display.

Anime Page:
The header just contains an h1 element. The first element in the body is a navigation element that takes you to the other pages.
Upon hovering on one of the buttons, it lights up to have a gradient that continues into the other buttons.
The page is modular, which makes it extremely easy to add more sections.
The top flexbox row of the section has the Anime Title with information on the anime.
The second flexbox row of the section has an image of the anime that links to an external site if the viewer wants more information on the anime.
It also contains a description of the anime.
The third flexbox row contains a description of a character from the anime, along with an image of them.
The bottom flexbox row is my opinion on the anime, as well as a score out of 10.
The body sections below it would repeat downwards.
The footer is an h2.
