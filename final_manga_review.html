                    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Though this story is one of the saddest I've ever read, it's also one of the best. Punpun as a character is written so well, and there's fantastic art to accompany it. Don't read this if you're in a bad mood, or if you're in lesser mental health. However, definitely read this if you want to be in the feels for a weekend.</p>

                    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>This is a manga that I absolutely adore. It was the first manga I ever completed, which lets it hold a special place in my heart. If you want to read a very gore heavy, silly, insane mystery unfold, while having a really fun cast of characters on both the Hero and Villain side, check out this manga.</p>
